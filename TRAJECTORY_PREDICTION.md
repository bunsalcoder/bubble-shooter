# Trajectory Prediction Feature

## Overview
The bubble shooter game now includes a trajectory prediction system that shows players exactly where their bubble will land before they shoot. This feature provides a visual guide to help players make more accurate shots.

## How It Works

### Activation
- **Hold and Drag**: Click and hold the mouse button while moving the cursor to activate the trajectory prediction
- **Real-time Updates**: The trajectory updates in real-time as you move the mouse
- **Visual Feedback**: A glowing animated arrow shows the predicted path

### Visual Elements

1. **Trajectory Path**: 
   - A glowing line that shows the exact path the bubble will follow
   - Color matches the current bubble's color
   - Animated glow effect for better visibility

2. **Animated Arrowhead**:
   - Pulsing arrowhead at the end of the trajectory
   - Shows the final landing position
   - Size animates for better visual feedback

3. **Animated Dots**:
   - Small white dots that travel along the trajectory path
   - Creates a flowing animation effect
   - Helps visualize the bubble's movement

4. **Starting Point Indicator**:
   - Pulsing circle at the launch position
   - Shows where the bubble will start from
   - Matches the bubble's color

### Technical Implementation

#### Trajectory Calculation
The system uses advanced collision detection to predict:
- Wall bounces (left and right walls)
- Bubble collisions with existing bubbles in the grid
- Final landing position on the hexagonal grid

#### Key Functions
- `predictTrajectory()`: Calculates the complete trajectory path
- `calculateShootDirection()`: Determines initial velocity based on mouse position
- `drawTrajectoryArrow()`: Renders the visual trajectory elements

#### Collision Detection
The prediction system uses the same collision detection logic as the actual game:
- Checks for wall collisions and calculates bounces
- Detects collisions with existing bubbles
- Determines the final grid position where the bubble will attach

### User Experience

#### Benefits
- **Improved Accuracy**: Players can see exactly where their shot will land
- **Strategic Planning**: Better understanding of shot angles and bounces
- **Learning Tool**: Helps new players understand the game mechanics
- **Visual Appeal**: Beautiful animated effects enhance the game experience

#### Controls
- **Hold Mouse**: Activate trajectory prediction
- **Move Mouse**: Update trajectory in real-time
- **Release Mouse**: Shoot the bubble along the predicted path
- **Click**: Quick shot without trajectory (existing behavior)

### Performance
- Trajectory calculations are optimized for real-time performance
- Visual effects use efficient rendering techniques
- Prediction is disabled when bubble is already moving
- Automatic cleanup when trajectory is no longer needed

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple trajectory options for complex shots
- Trajectory history for learning from previous shots
- Advanced prediction for special bubble effects
- Customizable trajectory visualization options
